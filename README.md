#Map The Night
  * This is full stack application that allows an authenticated user (via Twitter)
    to browse the nightlife in their area and track which places of interest they
    cane be found that night. The user can then tweet that information to their friends on
    Twitter. Fulfills the following user stories:
      * As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area
      * As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight
      * As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there
      * As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again

    Powered by Node.js, React.js, and MongoDB. Part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.
    A working prototype of this application can be found [here](map-the-night.herokuapp.com)
