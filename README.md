#Map The Night
  * This is full stack application that allows a user to browse the nightlife in their area and
    track which places of interest they can be found that night. The user can then tweet that information
    to their friends on Twitter.

    Powered by Node.js, React.js, and MongoDB. Part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum.
    A working prototype of this application can be found [here](http://map-the-night.herokuapp.com)
